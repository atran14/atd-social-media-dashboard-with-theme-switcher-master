### What I learned
#### Gradient border

I really didn't expect this to be hard until *the* 3rd card. At first, I initially thought that using the familiar `border`-related property would suffice. Unfortunately, it didn't work with the Instagram stats card (since it uses a gradient border), so that idea was quickly scrapped. What ultimately help me (after numerous trials and errors) was... simpler than I thought it would be: have a `<div>` wrapper with said gradient background, with its height *a tad* higher than its contents (which will house the actual content of the card).

```tsx
<div
   style={{
     position: 'relative',
     background: primaryColor,
     padding:"3px 0 0 0",
     borderRadius: "5px",
     overflow:'hidden'
   }}
>
   <div className="overall-stats__item">
     // < contents here >
   </div>
</div>
```

#### Creating a toggler

This is out of my field, so I did end up referencing a few tutorials on how to create one. Essentially, it's a disguised checkbox-`<input>` with a accompanying `<label>` that would be the main way to style it to look like the toggler. The ball inside is using the `<label>`'s `::after` pseudo-element

#### Light/dark mode switching

It was quite interesting seeing how one could use CSS variable to enable dark/light mode of a site. I have two CSS classes, `.light` and `.dark`, with each containing same set of variables for each component of the page. The difference lies in the fact that each variable will be assigned different color schemes suitable for dark/light theme. These classes are applied to the root of the app, so that it and its descendant can utilize them using `var()`.

```scss
.light {
    --bg: #{$clr-neutral-bg--light-theme};
    --bg-top: #{$clr-neutral-card-bg--light-theme};
    --card-bg: #{$clr-neutral-card-bg--light-theme};
    --text-primary: #{$clr-neutral-text-blue-very-dark--light-theme};
    --text-neutral: #{$clr-neutral-text-blue-grayish-dark--light-theme};
}

.dark {
    --bg: #{$clr-neutral-bg--dark-theme};
    --bg-top: #{$clr-neutral-card-bg--dark-theme};
    --card-bg: #{$clr-neutral-card-bg--dark-theme};
    --text-primary: #{$clr-neutral-text-white--dark-theme};
    --text-neutral: #{$clr-neutral-text-blue--dark-theme};
}

.app {
    ...
    background-color: var(--bg);
    ...
}

body {
    background: var(--bg);
}

.main-bg {
    ...
    background-color: var(--bg-top);
}

etc.
```

### Continued development

It would be a pain in the butt to have to enable dark mode every time the user reloads the page. I will explore ways to remember the user's preference.
In addition, I'm probably going to start exploring Styled Components and also Next.js React library. Aside from being useful for creating static sites, they seems to be interesting, personally.
